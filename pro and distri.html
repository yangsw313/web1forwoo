      In the early 1990s, Cheeto released "Flamin' Hot Cheetos".[13] The variety was invented by a janitor, Richard Monta√±ez, who observed that the brand did not have any products targeting Latinos.[13] The Washington Post would go on to call them "something of a cultural phenomenon",[14] with Newsweek noting that it "rejuvenated the brand" and would become a "central element in Cheetos marketing".[15]

    <p>Cheetos are among the snack varieties included in the Frito-Lay Munchies snack mix.</p>
    <p>With the introduction of Frito-Lay's Natural line, Natural Cheetos were introduced in the mid-2000s, touting all-natural ingredients and real Wisconsin white cheddar cheese. They accompany other Frito-Lay products in the Natural line and compete in the market space occupied by other health-conscious snack foods, such as Pirate's Booty. The Natural brand was re-branded to Simply in 2014.[16]

    <p>Cheetos first entered Brazil in 1976,[17] followed by other countries such as Australia during the 1980s.[18] In 1994, Cheetos became the first American brand of snack food to be made and distributed in China.[19] As the distribution of Cheetos expanded outside the U.S. to include more than 36 different countries,[20] localized versions were produced to conform to regional tastes and cultural preferences.[21]

    <p>Frito-Lay conducted extensive testing before settling on flavors for the Chinese market, with ranch dressing, North Sea crab, smoked octopus and caramel being passed up for two flavors: Savory American Cream and Zesty Japanese Steak.[22] These flavors were produced as the result of focus group testing, in which the original Crunchy Cheetos did not test as well.[22][23] Strawberry Cheetos, a plain corn Cheeto coated in strawberry icing, were released in Japan in 2008.[24] In 2013, a Pepsi-flavored Cheeto was introduced in Japan, and a Mountain Dew-flavored variety was available in 2014.[25] In India, Cheetos Whoosh are sold, made of ingredients such as whole grain and vegetables.[26] In Pakistan Cheetos are available in six different flavors: Bites: Vegetable, Stars: Cream N' Herb, Ocean Safari: Cheese, X & O: Spicy Twist, Red Flavoured Mast and Ketchup.[27] The sole Cheetos product produced in Australia is Cheetos Cheese & Bacon Balls.[28] Cheetos come in many different colors, the most popular being orange and red.

    <p>In 2015, Frito-Lay released a limited edition cinnamon sugar-flavored snack called Sweetos to U.S. markets. Sweetos were the first sweet snack that Cheetos had released in the United States in the brand's 67-year history.[29]

    <p>In the first week of 2020, Frito-Lay began distributing "Cheetos popcorn".[30][31]
